## Notes and Excerpts

There is a SIDES system for sharing info. It reduces improper payments, but only a fifth of employers use it? Those that don't fail to respond to 40 percent of worker info requests.

> The new PUA program extends benefits to those who are classified as self-employed, independent contractors, those with limited work history, and other 
individuals not traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits who are unable to 
work as a direct result of COVID-19. PUA is similar to the Disaster 
Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program, which the OIG has audited.

For the DUA, they report 
> Our audit in one state found improper payments to over 71 percent of the 420 
sampled claims, many for more than one reason. 

(People not actually unemployed, or people who didn't have adequate documentation of continuing eleigibility.)




> The 2009 Recovery Act included a weekly benefit augmentation similar to the 
CARES Act, but instead of $600 it was the significantly lesser amount of $25. 

(But they dont have good data about improper payment rates.)

> A key control 
for doing so is effective use of the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH).[^NDNHaccess]

> In Fiscal Year 2017, DOL estimated the UI program improperly paid more than 
$1 billion to claimants who were ineligible for benefits because they had returned 
to work. ETA classifies these types of overpayments as “benefit year earnings 
(BYE) overpayments.” Since 2011, ETA has mandated that states use the NDNH 
to detect and prevent BYE improper payments. States also use the State 
Directory of New Hires (SDNH) to identify BYE overpayments.

[^NDNHaccess]: [No way for me to access it. Law rquires only accessible to specific agencies.](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS22889/10)

> Despite an 8 percent reduction in overpayments, states underutilized 
new hire directories
