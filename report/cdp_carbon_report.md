## My Summary

The majority of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions (roughly 70%) come from the burning of fossil fuels.
This report looks at the supply-side of those emissions by tabulating the amount of fossil fuels produced by a number of large firms/organizations.

For each firm in their sample, they add up the firm's direct operational emissions[^scope1footnote] 
and the emissions caused by the downstream combustion of fuels they sell.
For the latter, they estimate these numbers simply by taking the unit sales of each firm and multiplying it by coefficients representing the emissions per unit (eg tonnes of CO2 per barrel of oil).

The end result is a table ranking fossil-fuel extractors by the 
amount of emissions caused, directly or indirectly, by their extraction activities.
(This is almost the same as ranking firms by the amount of fossil fuels extracted, just with a few sensible adjustments and weights.)


[^scope1footnote]: Direct Operational Emissions, [aka Scope 1 Emissions](https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance), are emissions from sources directly controlled by the firm. For this report, that includes the emissions from the firm's energy consumption (it takes energy to run the extraction machinery) and fugitive emissions.[^fugitivefootnote]

[^fugitivefootnote]: Fugitive Emissions result from the leakage of fossil fuels during extraction and transportation, and from the intentional flaring of gases. Oftentimes, pockets of methane come out of a coal mine or oil well. It wouldn't make sense to set up infrastructure leading to every single oil well to capture and transport the methane. So the most environmentally sensible thing to do is to burn it (pound for pound, CO2 is less bad than methane). According to [this page on emissions from our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector), Fugitive emissions account for roughly six percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

## My Complaint about Internet Discourse

This report is an interesting and worthwhile document, 
but it's also the source of one of the most annoyingly idiotic arguments on the internet.

The internet discourse typically goes like this: 
Someone mentions the need to cut back on carbon emissions,
and maybe brings up the fact that individual consumers can contribute by traveling less and reducing meat consumption.
Then someone chimes in saying "Well, actually, just 100 companies are responsible for 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions." They imply or outright state that there's no need to change our lifestyles to mitigate climate change; that we just need to force the evil capitalists to stop polluting for fun.

<aside>
In case it isn't obvious to you why this is a nonsensical: 
Supply equals demand.
If I buy an apple, someone has sold it to me.
If I sell an apple, I am selling it to someone.
When I use fossil fuels, some firm extracted them.
And except for fugitive emissions, the fossil fuels being extracted are being extracted *because someone wants to use them.*
</aside>

This kind of argument is especially frustrating because people link this report to back up their assertions,
despite never even having read the thing.
And I know none of them have read it, because even if they missed the part which says that 90% of the tabulated emissions come from downstream energy consumption, the fact that the number one company on the list is "China" should have clued them in to the fact they're misinterpreting the headline.

This is a silly emotional response on my part, but it makes me anxious about humanity's collective ability to seek truth. 
A few years ago, it felt to me like climate-change denial was culturally waning.
And then a brand new species of denialism appeared to fill the ecological niche left empty.[^socialbubble]

[^socialbubble]: At least in my filtered part of the social network. I'd wager the classic "Republican" strain is still more common in absolute terms.

<!--Some portion of Republicans deny climate change is happening. A larger portion of democrats say oil companies are completely to blame. What portion of the latter group believes that in the silly way? Unlikely but possible that the new strain is already more common.-->

<!--If you're actually curious about the sources of GHG emissions, I highly recommend reading [this page on emissions from our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector).-->
