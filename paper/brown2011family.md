## Abstract

> In order to assess the child welfare impact of policies governing divorced parenting,
such as child support orders, child custody assignments, and marital dissolution standards, one must consider their influence on not only the divorce rate but also spouses’
fertility choices and child investments. We develop a model of fertility, parenting, and
divorce, from which we derive estimates of parental preferences and a child cognitive
ability production function, using data on parental time allocation, children’s cognitive
attainment, and realized fertility and divorce. Family policies that reduce divorce are
simulated to have significant negative impacts on both fertility and child development.




## Notes and Excerpts



> The model is estimated using data from the PSID and the CDS (a subsample of households with young children from the PSID) using the Method of Simulated Moments (MSM).
The model we estimate is somewhat parsimonious


One of the useful features of the panel is that they can compare children whose parents are divorced to those whose parents *will* divorce in the future.
