## Abstract

> We ran a large randomized controlled experiment among about 150,000 recipients of 
unemployment benefits insurance in France in order to evaluate the impact of part-time 
unemployment benefits. We took advantage of the lack of knowledge of job seekers 
regarding this program and sent emails presenting the program. The information provision 
had a significant positive impact on the propensity to work while on claim, but reduced the 
unemployment exit rate, showing important lock-in effects into unemployment associated 
with part-time unemployment benefits. The importance of these lock-in effects implies that 
decreasing the marginal tax rate on earnings from work while on claim in the neighborhood 
of its current level does not increase labor supply and increases the expenditure net of taxes 
of the unemployment insurance agency.
