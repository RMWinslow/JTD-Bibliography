## Abstract

> The expiration of the temporary $600 boost to weekly UI benefits under the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) led to a sharp, unprecedented, 98 percentage point reduction (on average) in the replacement rate during a time when employment was recovering during the Covid recession. Leveraging the considerable variation in this drop across states, I use a difference-in-differences event study design to estimate the macro employment effects. I find little impact of job gains from the benefit reduction, especially when I focus on groups (non-college graduates, and those from non-high-income households) that comprise of most UI recipients. The estimates rule out job gains implied by much of the micro UI duration elasticities from the existing literature.


## Notes and Excerpts

> I use an event-study design using
the new, high-frequency, Census Household Pulse Survey (HPS), and consider how non-college,
adult worker employment evolved differentially by the state level variation in the median earnings
replacement rates following the expiration of the FPUC.

Replacement rates varied across states.
Used to predict employment effect of 600 dollar FPUC ending.
Point estimate is negative (opposite to what you might expect) but statistically indistinguishable from zero.

<!--
> My findings of limited sensitivity of employment to UI generosity are similar to what was found
in Altonji et al. (2020) and Bartik et al. (2020) using different data and empirical design, focusing
on the introduction of the FPUC and rehiring at the outset of the crisis

> The closest to this paper is the study conducted by Finamor and Scott (2021), who also
study how individual level employment outcomes changed for workers in Homebase using variation
in replacement rates over 2020 within state-industry-week cells.

>  In both panels, the DID estimates are
not statistically distinguishable from zero. In my preferred specification with all controls, the
magnitude of the DID estimate on employment probability (-0.011, s.e. = 0.015), along with the
July sample employment rate of 0.60, implies a 1.8% reduction in jobs from the expiration of
FPUC. Recall that labor supply consideration suggests employment should rise from the benefit
cut, so the point estimate are of the “wrong” sign.

And the confidence interval rules out more than a few percentage points of employment increase.


He compares this to micro estimates of duration elasticity.
That is, how does job finding react to the duration of benefits?
Range of 0.1-0.9 is likely.
But these elasticities would suggest a ΔE of 0.9M-8.2M

> When we focus on those without a college degree—who compose
of around 79% of the UI recipients, and 67% of labor force participants—the 95% confidence
intervals rule out out elasticities larger than 0.19.


<!--
> More relevant to our case, as Landais, Michaillat, and Saez (2017) and Kekre
(2019) point out, macro employment effects of a benefit cut may be more negative than the micro
estimates due to search and aggregate demand externalities

> Going forward, future research would benefit from
better understanding the source of this very modest employment response to UI benefit generosity,
and whether it was driven by unusually low micro-level response of unemployment duration, or
macro-level wedges affecting aggregate employment.7
