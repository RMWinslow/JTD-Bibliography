## Abstract

> We assess how the sudden and widespread shift to working from home during the 
pandemic impacted how managers allocate time throughout their working day. We 
analyze the results from an online time-use survey with data on 1,192 knowledge workers 
(out of which 973 are managers) in two waves, a pre-pandemic wave collected in 
August/2019 (615 participants, out of which 506 are managers) and a post-pandemic wave 
collected in August/2020 (577 participants, out of which 464 are managers). Our findings 
indicate that the forced transition to WFH created by the COVID pandemic was associated 
with a drastic reduction in commuting time for managers, but also an increase in time 
spent in work rather than on personal activities. This included reallocating time gained 
from commuting into more time spent in meetings, possibly to recoup some of the 
extemporaneous interactions that typically happen in the office. This change is particularly 
pronounced for managers employed in larger organizations. We use the results from the 
time-use studies to discuss implications for the development of new technologies.
