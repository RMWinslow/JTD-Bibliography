## Abstract

> In this paper, I use kinks in the U.S. partial unemployment insurance schedule
to study the response of claimants to the program. Partial unemployment insurance
enables claimants to keep part of their unemployment benefits when they work in
low-earnings jobs. When U.S. claimants earn over a state-specific threshold, termed
the “disregard”, their benefits are reduced at a 100% marginal tax rate above that
amount. This reduction in current benefits leads to an increase in future benefits,
with the result that forward-looking claimants are taxed according to a lower dynamic marginal tax rate. To account for these mechanisms, I develop a dynamic
model of claimants, who work in part-time/temporary jobs while searching for permanent jobs. Using administrative data on weekly claims, I document substantial
bunching of unemployment insurance claimants at the disregard level. I estimate
that the earnings elasticity to the net-of-tax-rate (at the intensive margin) lies between 0.1 and 0.2. Using this estimate, simulations show that setting the benefit
reduction rate at 80% is Pareto improving, as the current schedule induces claimants
to inefficiently reduce their earning
