## Abstract

> This study examines male and female course persistence and choice of economics degree via a combination of student, instructor, and structural characteristics. We find that students of both genders who declare economics as their major are more likely to take additional economics courses than their non-major peers. Additionally, students' economics grades are a significant determinant of course persistence and degree selection, but men and women respond somewhat differently to their absolute and relative grades. Finally, men's economics degree selection is significantly correlated with their math abilities, while women's economics degree selection is correlated with both their math and verbal aptitudes.
