## Abstract

> We revisit the causes, welfare consequences, and policy implications of the dispersion in households' labor market outcomes using a model with uninsurable risk, incomplete asset markets, and home production. Allowing households to be heterogeneous in both their disutility of home work and their home production efficiency, we find that home production amplifies welfare-based differences, meaning that inequality in standards of living is larger than we thought. We infer significant home production efficiency differences across households because hours working at home do not covary with consumption and wages in the cross section of households. Heterogeneity in home production efficiency is essential for inequality, as home production would not amplify inequality if differences at home only reflected heterogeneity in disutility of work.



## My Notes

### classroom discussion

A potential tangential teaching example.
This paper's model might not be good for presenting in class.
But the concepts are very relevant to the discussion of leisure in chapter 4.

> It is well known, however, that households spend roughly half as much time in home production activities such as child care, shopping, and cooking as in the market.

"Blah blah blah, here's what leisure means,
incidentally, one of the professors here studies leisure in more detail...
yes indeed, economics is a broader field than what many think of it as,
anyways, we aren't worrying about that here."


### Idle thought about my household

I was talking with someone, mentioned that I have enough savings to survive a couple years.
He says "wow, how horrible your standard of living must be to save that much money on such a low salary".
I pointed to supplemental income. 
But another factor for quality of life is my household's very high home production productivity.

### Marriage

> Our model features a single decision maker within each household. We model hours worked across spouses as perfect substitutes and in our quantitative results, ... The perfect substitutability of hours (across sectors and spouses) is essential for the no-trade result. We can extend the model for separate disutility of work by spouse.

### P and N sectors

To make the model identifiable, they assume there are two distinct types of chores:

- N type, where people vary by efficiency but dislike it the same amount as they dislike working 
- P type, where people vary by how much they dislike doing it, but have the same skill levels

To split tasks into the two types, they index them by how manually intensive they are. Above-median chores are type P, below median are type N.

- Type N: skills vary: childcare, shopping, nursing, "other"
- Type P: preferences vary, but same skill level: cooking, cleaning, gardening, laundry, "other"

Does the analysis change if the categories are split differently? 
The categories don't feel right to me.

People wildly vary in cooking skill.
I like cooking just as much as my wife does. 
But she does most of the cooking because she is *much, much* better at it.

Conversely, I am just as good at shopping as my wife is,
but dislike shopping more than she does.
(If anything bet I'm a more efficient shopper because I just want to get out of there.)

My intuition is that a better indicator is the variance in wages within the comparable occupation.
That might introduce a correlation in dispersions though. I don't think that would have major effects on the analysis. But who knows?

Sensitivity analyses in table VIII.
Eyeballing it, I don't see anything about different splits,
nor in the appendix.
That might be a project to do this weekend.
