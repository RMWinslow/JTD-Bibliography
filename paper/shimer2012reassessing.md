## Abstract

> This paper uses readily accessible aggregate time series to measure the probability that an employed worker becomes unemployed and the probability that an unemployed worker finds a job, the ins and outs of unemployment. Since 1948, the job finding probability has accounted for three-quarters of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate in the United States and the employment exit probability for one-quarter. Fluctuations in the employment exit probability are quantitatively irrelevant during the last two decades. Using the underlying microeconomic data, the paper shows that these results are not due to compositional changes in the pool of searching workers, nor are they due to movements of workers in and out of the labor force. These results contradict the conventional wisdom that has guided the development of macroeconomic models of the labor market since 1990.




## Notes and Excerpts

Assumptions:
- all workers ex ante identical
  - in any particular period, everyone has same job finding and exit probability
- Only transition between employment and unemployment

> Given these assumptions, I show that the
probability that an unemployed worker finds a job during a period is a simple function of the number of unemployed
workers at the start of the period, the number of unemployed workers at the end of the period, and the number of unemployed workers at the end of the period who were employed at some point during the period.


> assume that all unemployed workers find a job—become employed—with probability Ft and all employed workers lose a job—become unemployed—with probability Xt during period t
