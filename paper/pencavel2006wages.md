## Abstract

> The authors investigate how worker-owned and capitalist enterprises differ with
respect to wages, employment, and capital in Italy, the market economy with the great
est incidence of worker-owned and worker-managed firms. Estimates calculated using
a matched employer-worker panel data set for the years 1982-94 largely corroborate
the implications of orthodox behavioral models of the two types of enterprise. Co-ops
had 14% lower wages than capitalist enterprises, on
average;
more volatile wages; and
less volatile employment. Given the quality of the data set analyzed
the authors argue,
these results can be regarded as having broad generality.
