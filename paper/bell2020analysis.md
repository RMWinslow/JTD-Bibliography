## Summary

> Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, 49% of the California workforce has filed for 
unemployment insurance (UI) benefits — a labor market crisis unprecedented in the state’s history. This series of 
policy briefs uses close to real-time information on daily initial UI claims in California from the state's Employment 
Development Department to better understand the magnitude of COVID-19’s labor market impacts and how 
different types of workers are experiencing these impacts. This research is based on a partnership between the 
Labor Market Information Division of the California Employment Development Department and the California 
Policy Lab, a research center at the University of California, with sites at the UCLA and Berkeley campuses.


## Notes and Excerpts

This report has some graphs of partial unemployment recipients as a percent of total beneficiaries. Doesn't seem to spike up during FPUC.
Appendix also has a breakdown by industry. PUI much higher utilization for restaurants. Could say something about some industries having more flexibility.
