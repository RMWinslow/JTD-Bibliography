## Abstract

> This paper shows that the decline in trade costs that underlies the increase in observed global
bilateral gross trade allows has notably contributed to the surge in the size of net trade imbalances
over the past four decades. To show this, I propose a framework that embeds a quantitative
multi-country general equilibrium model of international trade based on Ricardian comparative
advantages into a dynamic framework in which trade imbalances arise endogenously. I identify
and describe two mechanisms through which declines in trade costs lead to larger imbalances in
the model. By exploiting the information in bilateral trade allows, among other data, I calibrate
the model and provide a decomposition that shows that 69 percent of the increase in the size of
world trade imbalances can be explained by the decline in trade costs across countries. In other
words, lower trade costs have not only allowed for more trade across countries in a particular
point in time, but also for more trade over time. Moreover, the e§ect of lower trade costs on
trade imbalances is heterogeneous across countries. In particular, trade imbalances in countries
like the United States and China have been significantly affected by the decline in trade costs. I
also show that the welfare gains from lower trade costs can di§er substantially from those that
are obtained when changes in trade imbalances are not taken into account.
