## Abstract

> This chapter examines the labor supply effects of social insurance programs. We argue that this topic deserves separate treatment from the rest of the labor supply literature because individuals may be imperfectly informed as to the rules of the programs and because key parameters are likely to differ for those who are eligible for social insurance programs, such as the disabled. Furthermore, differences in social insurance programs often provide natural experiments with exogenous changes in wages or incomes that can be used to estimate labor supply responses. Finally, social insurance often affects different margins of labor supply. For example, the labor supply literature deals mostly with adjustments in the number of hours worked, whereas the incentives of social insurance programs frequently affect the decision of whether to work at all.

> The empirical work on unemployment insurance (UI) and workers' compensation (WC) insurance finds that the programs tend to increase the length of time employees spend out of work. Most of the estimates of the elasticities of lost work time that incorporate both the incidence and duration of claims are close to 1.0 for unemployment insurance and between 0.5 and 1.0 for workers' compensation. These elasticities are substantially larger than the labor supply elasticities typically found for men in studies of the effects of wages or taxes on hours of work. The evidence on disability insurance and (especially) social security retirement suggests much smaller and less conclusively established labor supply effects. Part of the explanation for this difference probably lies in the fact that UI and WC lead to short-run variation in wages with mostly a substitution effect. Our review suggests that it would be misleading to apply a universal set of labor supply elasticities to these diverse problems and populations.


## Notes and Excerpts

> Approximately 97% of all wage and salary workers are in jobs that are covered by
unemployment insurance. The main categories of workers not covered are the selfemployed, employees of small farms, and household employees whose earnings are
below the threshold amount. Despite this near universal coverage, less than forty
percent of the unemployed received UI in many recent years7 . The cause of this
low rate of receipt is largely that individuals who are new entrants or reentrants to
the labor force, who have irregular work histories, and individuals who quit or are
fired from their last job are typically not eligible for benefits. 


> About 35% of claimants receive the
maximum benefit. For these individuals, the fraction of their previous earnings replaced
by UI can be much lower than 50%.


> A convenient indicator of the work disincentive of UI is the fraction of previous
after-tax earnings replaced by after-tax benefits, the after-tax replacement rate. This
replacement rate has fallen dramatically in recent years, particularly due to the taxation
of benefits, and is now typically under one-half. As recently as 1986, some people had
replacement rates near one (often those lifted by the minimum benefit), implying that
they would receive from UI nearly what they would earn if they returned to work.12

Second, the labor supply elasticities estimated in the labor economics literature span
a huge range. Literature surveys such as Pencavel (1986) and Killingsworth (1983)
find wide dispersion in estimates of income and substitution effects. Fuchs, Krueger
and Poterba (1998) also find that there is little agreement among economists on the
magnitude of labor supply elasticities. A major shortcoming in the broader labor supply
literature is that it is difficult to identify exogenous changes in wages or income that can
be used to estimate labor supply responses. 


incomplete experience rating? Need to come back later to try groking that a bit more.


> Several of the studies, including Classen (1979), Solon (1985), and Meyer
(1990, 1992a), find elasticities of duration with respect to the level of benefits over 0.5.
The elasticity estimates with respect to the potential duration (length) of benefits tend
to be much lower.  
> ...  
> Overall, the combined effect of benefits on unemployment through incidence and
duration is suggested to be near one by these studies. This result is consistent with the
aggregate analysis of twenty OECD countries by Nickell (1998) who finds an elasticity
of unemployment with respect to the replacement rate of close to one.
