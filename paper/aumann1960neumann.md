## Excerpt from Intro

> The use of side payments in the classical1 theory of n-person games involves three restrictive assumptions. First, there must be a common medium of exchange (such as money) in which the side payments may be effected; next, the side payments must be physically and legally feasible; and finally, it is assumed that utility is "unrestrictedly transferable," i.e. that each player's utility for money is a linear function of the amount of money.3 These assumptions severely limit the applicability of the classical theory; in particular, the last assumption has been characterized by Luce and Raiffa as being "exceedingly restrictiveâ€”for many purposes it renders n-person theory next to useless." It is the purpose of this paper to present the outline of a theory that parallels the classical theory, but makes no use of side payments.
