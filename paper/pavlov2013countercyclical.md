## Abstract

> The standard one-sector real business cycle model is unable to generate expectations-driven fluctuations. The addition of countercyclical markups and modest investment adjustment costs offers an easy fix to this conundrum. The simulated model replicates the regular features of U.S. aggregate fluctuations.


## My Notes

This paper, as well as the other papers it cites, seems like it may be useful for brainstorming 3102 teaching examples.
