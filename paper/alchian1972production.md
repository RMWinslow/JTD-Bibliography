## Abstract

NA, but here's the first paragraph:

> The mark of a capitalistic society is that 
resources are owned and allocated by such 
nongovernmental organizations as firms, 
households, and markets. Resource owners 
increase productivity through cooperative 
specialization and this leads to the demand 
for economic organizations which facilitate cooperation. When a lumber mill 
employs a cabinetmaker, cooperation between specialists is achieved within a firm, 
and when a cabinetmaker purchases wood 
from a lumberman, the cooperation takes 
place across markets (or between firms). 
Two important problems face a theory of 
economic organization-to explain the 
conditions that determine whether the 
gains from specialization and cooperative 
production can better be obtained within 
an organization like the firm, or across 
markets, and to explain the structure of 
the organization. 


## Notes and Excerpts

I can't be sure, but I think this paper came up in the context of a workshop,
and Mahdi was presenting some research ideas?
Either that, or it was related to the theory of the firm in Ellen's topics course.
(My copy says it was downloaded Thu, Jun 10, 2021, but that by its nature is a lower bound on datetime.)


Here are the notes I jotted down on the physical copy 
(though it's possible these are related to something else):

- Firms monitor to prevent shirking in team production.
- Benefits from non-shirk acrue to manager, residual claimant.
- Firms exist as an alternative to markets to gather info about inputs and allocate those inputs.

?AI increases quality of firm info, increasing advantage in comparison to markets?
