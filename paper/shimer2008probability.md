## Abstract

NA?

## Notes and Excerpts:



This paper (only 7 pages) shows a little model where workers wait for the economy to improve.
Duration dependence because a newly unemployed worker is more likely to be close to the threshold of accepting a job.

$\delta_i(t)$ is extra lifetime utility from taking the best job now vs staying unemployed.
Follows Brownian motion biased upwards.

Following Alvarez and Shimer's (2007) model of rest unemployment,
derives hazard rate of job finding as function of unemployment duration.


Compares to CPS panelish data (after 1994 - same issue I ran into)


> Fourth, I 
weigh observations using the CPS final weights 
and seasonally adjust the number of people 
with duration r with each subsequent employ? 
ment status (employed, unemployed, or inactive) 
using a difference-from-moving-average. 

> 51 percent 
of workers reporting one week duration find a 
job before the next survey and the share declines 
sharply thereafter. For workers with duration 
less than six months, the job finding probability 
averages 31 percent. It falls to 19 percent during 
the next six months and just 14 percent for work? 
ers who have been unemployed for over a year.5 


Splits data into 3 groups, based on average job finding rate.
Looks at high finding rate months and low finding rates.
Fits a curve to the difference.
Says that 




> the magnitude of the decline in the job find? 
ing probability is similar for all workers, regard? 
less of unemployment duration. Of course, this 
means that the percentage decline is largest for 
the long-term unemployed, so a reduction in 
the job finding probability disproportionately 
impacts the expected unemployment duration 
of those workers who are already long-term 
unemployed

CITATIONS TO READ

> Robert E. Hall (2005, 101) concludes from his 
examination of a variety of data sources that 
"Unemployment is high in a recession because 
jobs are hard to find, not because more job-seek? 
ers have been dumped into the labor market by 
elevated separation rates." Shimer (2007) shows 
that movements in the job finding probability 
account for three-quarters of the fluctuations 
in the unemployment rate in the United States 
during the postwar period, w




> a single job finding probability for all workers, 
economists have long recognized that the job 
finding probability falls with unemployment 
duration (Hyman B. Kaitz 1970)





> If workers are heterogeneous but 
each has a constant hazard of finding a job, 
dynamic sorting will lead to a declining aggre? 
gate hazard of finding a job as the good work? 
ers disappear from the stock of unemployed 
(see James Heckman and Burton Singer 1984; 
Stephen Machin and Alan Manning 1999 and 
the citations therein). 



> Still other explanations for duration dependence require a simple reinterpretation of the model. 
Melvyn G. Coles and Barbara Petrongolo (2003) emphasize the possibility that 
newly unemployed workers may quickly determine whether they are interested in any of the 
stock of available jobs. If not, they wait
