## Abstract

> We show that the largest increase in unemployment benefits in U.S. history had large spending impacts and small job-finding impacts. This finding has three implications. First, increased benefits were important for explaining aggregate spending dynamics—but not employment dynamics—during the pandemic. Second, benefit expansions allow us to study the MPC of normally low-liquidity households in a high-liquidity state. These households still have high MPCs. This suggests a role for persistent behavioral characteristics, rather than just current liquidity, in driving spending behavior. Third, the mechanisms driving our results imply that temporary benefit supplements are a promising countercyclical tool.

## My Notes

This paper contains some figures that might be good to mention in teaching.

> estimated one-month MPCs between 26 and 43 cents

(though note such households are suggested to have intrinsically higher MPC than average)


Context
- CARES ACt gave 600 USD per week April-July to unemployed people through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.
    - Also expanded unemployment insurance coverage to more people
    - and extended coverage for people who were already on UI
- CARES PUA expired at the end of July 2020
- Executive order extended coverage with "Lost Wages Assistance", but delays meant those were usually given out in Sept.
- New legislation authorized 300 USD payments Jan-Sept of 2021



Effect on Job-finding is modest. (See figure 3.)
They argue this is because the recession resulted in the job finding rate already being depressed, so the effect of the benefits was relatively small.

But They focus only on new-job-finding, deliberately ignoring recall. That makes me doubt the generalizability of their conclusions here.

The typical pattern for someone receiving these benefits wasn't that they lost their job.
It was that there hours were reduced by government mandate.
In fact, many of the people receiving these benefits were still employed at the time, just at reduced hours.


Section 4.4 says that:

> There is some evidence that the expiration of
the $600 supplement might have had a small effect on recalls but the evidence is hard to interpret, and
even the upper bound of plausible causal impacts on recalls still implies small aggregate employment
effects. There is no evidence of any effect of the $300 supplement on recalls.

But of course UI benefits won't reduce recall. You lose the benefits if you don't respond to the recall, right?
On the other hand, at least for the pandemic, you keep the benefits if you respond to the recall, as long as you don't work too much.
So the employment effect of the pandemic should be seen in reduced hours, not reduced unemployment status. No?

Look at the appendix graphs, I'm convinced it makes since to look at job-finding seperately from recall.
But it's still odd that "hour" doesn't get any crtl-f hits.

> We define a worker as having been recalled when they begin an employment spell with their prior
employer between five weeks before and three weeks after the end of a benefit spell.

Actually, based on this snippet from the appendix, either the paper is mismeasuring recall, 
or I am misremembering how the benefits programs worked.



I asked wife. She says recalled workers indeed got +300 per week if you don't work beyond a certain threshold.
Thresholds depends on per-person working hours. 
It was something like less than half. Spitballed 400 dollar threshold if you previously made 1000.
But with the extra 300 from feds, it made sense to stay below that threshold.

I found official verification of this [here](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20210225-0), though it doesn't go into details:

> The new guidance expands eligibility to three categories of workers: ... Workers laid off, or **who have had their work hours reduced** as a direct result of the pandemic.

Ah, the linked guidance was retroactive, but issued February 25, 2021
The paper's data only extends through February 2021

> Our sample runs
through February 2021 because this is when we can most reliably measure job-finding. Specifically,
benefit eligibility extensions mean that UI exits from April 2020 through February 2021 rarely reflect
benefit exhaustion and therefore usually reflect a return to work.4

> For example, the California Policy Lab (Bell et al. 2022) calculates that fewer than 3 in 1000 recipients exhausted
benefits during this time period. However, beginning in March 2021, there are a number of UI exits which do not reflect
job-finding because of a technical issue with how UI systems pay claims for spells that last longer than a year (Bell
et al. 2021). Extending our analysis to later periods therefore requires measuring job starts from direct deposit labor
income in order to distinguish between UI exits arising from job-finding and exhaustion.

Strange how the reduced hours aren't mentioned either. But if there were other reasons for excluded the relevant time period from their analysis, then it makes sense that they might not bother to discuss it.

Actually actually, I checked again. People were still getting the benefit bonus when they worked, even back in May 2020. They got less UI, but still got the full federal bonus. I don't think that was a Minnesota-specific thing...
No benefits in August, but then they "covered the gap" in september (6 times 300 once, plus the regular weekly).
No bonus in October Nov...
Benefit bonus comes back in January and last through September.



Anecdotally, employees tried to keep reduced hours until the 300 USD benefits subsided.
Still saw the labor shortage in aggregate after that, 
and no obvious pattern jumps out looking at Fred's graph of [Average Weekly Hours of All Employees, Leisure and Hospitality](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AWHAELAH) ([NSA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CEU7000000002))
so not sure why the employees my HH saw differed from the general vibe of the economy.

Hello,

I was talking to a restaurant manager, and they described the following pattern for their part-time employees' working decisions during the pandemic:
Employees continue to receive partial UI benefits after being recalled to work. 
The full federal bonus (600 then later 300 USD) is paid out as long as the employee receives any UI benefits. 
Thus the optimal thing for the employee to do is work some number of reduced hours just below the threshold that would result in their losing benefits.
And indeed, it wasn't until the 300 dollar bonus expired that employees wanted to work full hours again.
I wondered whether such situations 



I was talking to a restaurant manager, and they described how recalled employees still received the full federal bonus (600 then later 300 USD) to UI as long as they had reduced hours low enough to collect any UI benefits at all. Thus employees would aim to work just below this threshold, and only wanted longer hours again once the bonus 300 stopped being paid out.

I'm curious how common this kind of situation was. 

Just eyeballing the graph of average weekly hours for leisure/hospitality, I don't see a Sept 2021 spike (if anything avg hours looks a bit elevated during the benefits period), but anecdotally the manager made this sound like a common problem among part-time employers.

I was referred to your paper on Spending and Job-Finding Impacts of Expanded Unemployment Benefits, but the paper looks at the extensive margin, defining recall based on the end of a benefit spell. Still, I thought it might be worth asking:

Would you happen to have an idea how common it was for employees to be recalled but working low-enough hours to continue receiving pandemic UI? Is that something which can be observed in your data?

Thanks,
Robert Winslow
