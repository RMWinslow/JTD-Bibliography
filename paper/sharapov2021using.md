## Abstract

> Variance decomposition methods
allow strategy scholars to identify key sources of heterogeneity in firm performance. However, most extant
approaches produce estimates that depend on the order
in which sources are considered, the ways they are
nested, and which sources are treated as fixed or random effects. In this paper, we propose the use of an axiomatically justified, unique, and effective solution to
this limitation: the “Shapley Value” approach. We
show its effectiveness compared to extant methods
using both simulated and real data, and use it to
explore how the importance of business group effects
varies with group diversification and internationalization in a large, representative sample of European
firms. We thus demonstrate the method's superior
accuracy and its usefulness in asking and answering
new questions.


## Notes and Excerpts


> while the methods used for variance decomposition have been improved in a
number of ways (for an overview, see Guo, 2017, pp. 1328–1330), most extant approaches share
an important limitation: unless the effects under study are orthogonal, the estimates are sensitive to choices regarding the order in which the effects are introduced into the models; which
effects are treated as fixed versus random; and which effects are considered to be nested in
others.1

While random effects variance decomposition methods, which we will refer to as Variance Components Analysis
(VCA), do not share this order-dependence limitation when used to estimate models without a nesting structure, this is
because they make strong assumptions regarding effect distributions



> Alternative approaches have also been used, including simultaneous equation modeling
(Brush, Bromiley, & Hendrickx, 1999), nonparametric estimation (Ruefli & Wiggins, 2003), and
multilevel modeling (Guo, 2017; Hough, 2006; Misangyi et al., 2006). These are not exempt
from criticism (Guo, 2017; Hough, 2006; McGahan & Porter, 2005). The multilevel approach
appears to be the most promising, as it explicitly takes the cross-nested structure of variation in
firm performance into account. Examples include observations across time being nested within
firms, and firms in turn being cross-nested within both business groups and industries
(Misangyi et al., 2006), or firms being nested within corporate groups (Majumdar &
Bhattacharjee, 2014). Thus, this approach allows for the estimation of random effects variance
components like the VCA method but allows for general multilevel error structures in deriving
more accurate variance component estimates (Guo, 2017; Hough, 2006). It can produce estimates of the dispersion importance of both random and fixed effects. However the estimates
produced by a cross-nested multilevel approach will also depend on choices of which effects are
considered to be nested in others, and which cross-nesting effects (e.g., industry or corporate
group) are treated as being random versus fixed (see Misangyi et al., 2006, pp. 580–581).3



This paper goes on to compare SHAPLEY and other variance decomposition techniques on a simulated dataset.
