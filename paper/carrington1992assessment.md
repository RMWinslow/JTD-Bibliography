## Abstract

> Exposure to lead (Pb) continues to be a source of concern for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal regulatory agencies. Blood lead levels as low as 10 μg Pb/dl have been associated with impaired neurobehavioral development in children and infants. Because of exposure to the fetus, blood lead levels of 10 μg Pb/dl are also of concern in pregnant women. Blood lead levels of 30 μg Pb/dl have been associated with elevated blood pressure and other adverse effects in adults. The dietary exposure that results in these blood levels of concern were estimated to be 60 μg Pb/day for children age 6 years or younger, 150 μg Pb/day for children age 7 years or older, 250 μg Pb/day for pregnant women, and 750 μg Pb/day for adults. A provisional tolerable total dietary intake was derived by applying a factor of 10 to obtain an exposure level that would include some margin of safety.
