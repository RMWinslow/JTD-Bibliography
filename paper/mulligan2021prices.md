## Abstract

(For WP version)

> More than a dozen Federal policy changes since the year 2000 have affected incentives to
prescribe, manufacture, and purchase both prescription and illicitly-manufactured opioids. To
the extent that one of the policies, the 2013 “Holder memo,” had a meaningful effect on the cost
structure of suppliers of heroin and illicit fentanyl, standard consumer theory predicts that the
trend for opioid-involved fatalities would proceed in distinct phases. Prior to 2013, subsidies to,
and conveniences for, prescribers and consumers would increase total opioid consumption by
reducing the full price of Rx. More surprising is that, with heroin relatively cheap of late, any
Rx opioid policy could – and likely does – have the opposite total-consumption effect after 2013
than it would before, especially when the more expensive Rx opioid products are most affected.
Subsidies to benzodiazepines (an opioid complement) increase opioid consumption in both
phases. While policy changes at first reduced the full price of Rx, and then later increased it,
technological change in illicit markets is also a relevant factor over the longer term. 


## Notes


Simple idea. Two markets for a good. 
Legal Rx market with low fixed cost, high marginal cost.
Illicit market with high fixed cost (finding a dealer), low marginal cost.

If you make Rx drugs more expensive, effect on quantity depends on illicit market.
