## Abstract

> Venus lacks an internally generated magnetic field today. Whether one existed in the past is unknown, but critical to atmospheric evolution and potential habitability. Canonical models assume the core of Venus is cooling too slowly for convection and thus a magnetic dynamo to occur today. Core/mantle heat flow is suppressed in these models after a putative transition in mantle dynamics associated with widespread, volcanic resurfacing. However, recent studies of impact craters and other surface features support more steady heat loss over geologic time. Precipitation of MgO and/or SiO2 from the core can also drive compositional convection even with slow cooling. Here we reevaluate the likelihood that Venus has an “Earth-like” (at least partially liquid and chemically homogeneous) core using numerical simulations of the coupled atmosphere–surface–mantle–core evolution. An Earth-like core is only compatible with the modern lack of a dynamo if the thermal conductivity of core material is towards the higher end of modern estimates (i.e., >100 W m−1 K−1). If lower estimates like ∼40–50 W m−1 K−1 are actually correct, then we favor recent proposals that the core has completely solidified or preserved primordial stratification. Any simulation initialized with a homogeneous, liquid core predicts a global magnetic field with Earth-like surface strength for >2–3 billion years after accretion—consistent with all available observations—and also sporadic activity within the surface age while temperatures remain below the Curie point of magnetite. Therefore, future spacecraft missions should prioritize the first-ever magnetometer measurements below the ionosphere to search for crustal remanent magnetism.

## Notes

I just wanted to know whether a tidally locked planet could still have an intrinsic magnetic field. 
Venus isn't tidally lock but its spin is absurdly slow, so makes for a good comparison. 
According to this paper, Venus is still spinning fast enough to theoretically have a dynamo.
The problem is instead that there isn't convection in its core.
Maybe it was too cold and solidified. Maybe it's too insulated and so can't cool down fast enough.
According to their simulations, with a different planetary composition, Venus might still have a magnetic field.

So I'm going to say yeah, a tidally locked planet could have an internal dynamo, just as long as it has the right composition or some impact stirs up the primordial core or what have you.
