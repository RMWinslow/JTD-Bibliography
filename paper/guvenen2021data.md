## Abstract

> We study individual male earnings dynamics over the life cycle using panel data on millions of U.S. workers. Using nonparametric methods, we first show that the distribution of earnings changes exhibits substantial deviations from lognormality, such as negative skewness and very high kurtosis. Further, the extent of these nonnormalities varies significantly with age and earnings level, peaking around age 50 and between the 70th and 90th percentiles of the earnings distribution. Second, we estimate nonparametric impulse response functions and find important asymmetries: Positive changes for high-income individuals are quite transitory, whereas negative ones are very persistent; the opposite is true for low-income individuals. Third, we turn to long-run outcomes and find substantial heterogeneity in the cumulative growth rates of earnings and the total number of years individuals spend nonemployed between ages 25 and 55. Finally, by targeting these rich sets of moments, we estimate stochastic processes for earnings that range from the simple to the complex. Our preferred specification features normal mixture innovations to both persistent and transitory components and includes state-dependent long-term nonemployment shocks with a realization probability that varies with age and earnings.




## My Notes

> For example, 40% of men experience at most one year of nonemployment, while 18%
spend more than half of their working years as nonemployed. These numbers imply an
extremely high persistence in the long-term nonemployment state.

Two thoughts:
- First, this ties in well with what I found in MEBDI 22 about current status being a highly informative predictor or future unemployment status. (Does it? I might need to recheck the confusion matrix.)
- Secondly, does this vary by marital status? I can imagine either that having a second earner gives the person a kind of insurance which they can use to stay searching longer, or the opposite: that a married man has more pressure to find a job to support his family.
