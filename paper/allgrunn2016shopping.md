## Abstract

> We test the relative income elasticity of shopping at Walmart and Target using quarterly data from 1997-
2010. We seek to isolate the effects of income changes by controlling for price level, retail space, and
measures of time. Our findings indicate Walmart’s income elasticity, while lower than Target’s, is
positive, indicating shopping at both stores is normal rather than inferior.
