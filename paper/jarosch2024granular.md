## Abstract

> We develop a model where labor market structure affects the division of surplus between firms and workers. Using Austrian data we show that in more concentrated labor markets, workers are more likely to return to past employers. In our model, the possibility of these re-encounters endows firms with size-based market power since outside options are truly outside the firm: firms do not compete with their own vacancies. Hence, a worker's outside option is worse when bargaining with a larger firm, and wages depend on market structure. The quantified model suggests that such size-based market power could substantially reduce wages.


## Notes and Excerpts



> First, there is evidence from labor
market settings that changes in market structure sometimes affect prices but not quantities, which
is not a prediction of the standard model. For example, Prager and Schmitt (2022) study hospital
mergers and find that merging employers reduce wages but not employment.



> Empirically, we show that more concentrated markets indeed have higher re-encounter rates.

> We use the Austrian labor market data base (AMDB) that covers the universe of private sector
employment in Austria. For 1997 to 2015, the AMDB provides daily information on employment
and unemployment spells, reports annual wages (including base pay and bonus payments) for each
worker-firm combination, and contains worker characteristics (age, gender, nationality) and firm
characteristics (industry, geographical location, age).
