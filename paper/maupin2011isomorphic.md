## Abstract

> Many traditional and new musical instruments make use of
an isomorphic note layout across a uniform planar tessel-
lation. Recently, a number of hexagonal isomorphic key-
boards have become available commercially. Each such
keyboard or interface uses a single specific layout for notes,
with specific justifications as to why this or that layout is
better. This paper is an exploration of all possible note
layouts on isomorphic tessellations. We begin with an in-
vestigation and proof of isomorphism in the two regular
planar tessellations (Square and hexagonal), we describe
the history and current practice of isomorphic note layouts
from traditional stringed instruments to commercial hex
keyboards and virtual keyboards available on tablet com-
puters, and we investigate the complete space of such lay-
outs, evaluating the existing popular layouts and proposing
a set of new layouts which are optimized for specific mu-
sical tasks.


## My Notes

Very interesting paper. But I was dissapointed that:
- They don't actually enumerate all possible note layouts
- They don't treat note layouts as equivalent if they are rotations or reflections of another.

(Likely the first failing a necessary consequence of the second.)
