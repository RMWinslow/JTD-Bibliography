## Abstract

> Much human adaptation depends on the gradual accumulation of culturally transmitted knowledge and technology. Recent models of this process predict that large, well-connected populations will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small, isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of technology in small populations are consistent with this prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative tests. Both studies were based on data from continental populations in which contact rates were not available, and therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models. Here, we show that in Oceania, around the time of early European contact, islands with small populations had less complicated marine foraging technology. This finding suggests that explanations of existing cultural variation based on optimality models alone are incomplete because demography plays an important role in generating cumulative cultural adaptation. It also indicates that hominin populations with similar cognitive abilities may leave very different archaeological records, a conclusion that has important implications for our understanding of the origin of anatomically modern humans and their evolved psychology.

## My Notes

The authors look at detailed accounts of Pacific island cultures around the time of early European contact, classifying the fishing technology of each island according to variety and complexity. Island population size was the best predictor of both. The degree of contact with other islands also correlates with technology variety and complexity, but less so. (The distance between islands led to near autarky.)

Because the population size of an autarkic island is largely determined exogenously by the carrying capacity of local natural resources, they argue this lends evidence towards the notion that larger, more interconnected societies are capable of sustaining a more advanced technological base.

The authors are mainly concerned with the implications this has on interpreting archaeological evidence. But I was reminded of comments in Trade class about how the best thing for small countries to do is combine into one big country.
