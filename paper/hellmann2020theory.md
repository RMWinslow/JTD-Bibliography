## Abstract

> Beyond Covid-19, there is a growing interest in what economic structures will be needed to face ongoing pandemics. In this paper, we focus on the diagnostic problem and examine a new paradigm of voluntary self-testing by private individuals. We develop a dynamic model where individuals without symptoms face daily choices of either taking the risk of going out (to work and socialize), staying at home in self-isolation, or using a test to verify whether they are infected before going out. Our central insight is that the equilibrium public infection risk falls when home-based testing becomes cheaper and easier to use, even if they generate both false-positive (type I error) and false-negative (type II error) test outcomes. We also show that the presence of na√Øve individuals actually reduces the equilibrium infection risk in the economy. Overall our model shows that, even if inaccurate, home-based tests are vital for an economy facing an ongoing pandemic.
