## Abstract

> We study a labor market characterized by search frictions in which firms choose between posting non-negotiable
wage offers and bargaining wages with individual workers. We use the model to study the positive and normative
implications of heterogeneous wage-setting strategies in labor markets, as well as the potential effect of policies that
seek to regulate wage-setting. We analytically derive - and empirically validate - a testable prediction from the model
regarding the cross-sectional prevalence of bargaining and renegotiation of wages among workers. We then estimate
the model and use it to evaluate counterfactuals in which either wage-setting procedure is mandated. We find that
eliminating bargaining reduces the overall gender gap in wages by 6%, the education gap by 3%, and residual wage
dispersion by 12%, while leading to welfare losses for workers. Similar numbers are observed when bargaining is
mandated, with ensuing welfare gains for workers. Either policy raises output by 1-3% by eliminating inefficient job
mobility, but accounting for firm responses in vacancy creation can overturn these effects.


## Notes and Excerpts



> Since bargaining creates a link between workers’ outside options and current wages (that may themselves be used as
the outside option for setting future wages) one particular concern is that this creates a cascading cycle of disadvantage
for workers who have traditionally faced discrimination in the labor market



> Since the effective wage is scaled by each worker’s ability, a, the model preserves a wage decomposition that is typical
in empirical search: log wages can be decomposed into a component that is attributable to worker ability (log(a)) and a
residual component εit that is a function of the worker’s history of employment and job offers.
