JOLTS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, from the BLS


[Here's a link to download dataseries from JOLTS.](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?jt)

[Here's the BLS Glossary.](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/glossary.htm)

Layoffs and discharge rates spike up in March and April but then quickly fell back down.
Here's the seasonally adjusted numbers:  
`2020	1.2	1.3	8.6	7.1	1.6	1.6	1.3	1.1	1.1	1.2	1.5	1.3`

Hires rates actually seemed to go up a bit, oddly.  
`2020	4.0	3.9	3.4	3.1	6.1	5.4	4.5	4.2	4.2	4.3	4.1	3.9`

But part of that is that the denominator is the number of employed. So fewer employed would make hires rate go up.

I guess I could get unemployment data to plot hires / unemployed. 
But hires level also spikes down then quickly up, then returns to pre-pandemic trend.
So I think my decision to model it as a one period shock is fine. Whatever.
