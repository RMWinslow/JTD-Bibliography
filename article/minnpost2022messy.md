## Notes

- Pre-covid MN UI had 1.7 billion in reserves.
- Depleted during COVID. Had to borrow more than a billion from US treasury.
- Only foot the bill for the standard UI payments. Fed covered the 600 dollar bonus, plus the checks for gig and contract workers.
- Typically employers pay taxes to build up trust fund. Walz wanted to use state surplus to pay it off.
